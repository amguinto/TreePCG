(THIS IS A HACK, BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY DEPENDENCIES
AND THE CODE IS TOO SHORT TO JUSTIFY A REWRITE :-( )

To change precision, see instructions at the start
of the file

../haoran_code/common.h

specifically flags such as
#define USE_FLOAT128 (which uses built-in floats, not too useful)
#define MPFR_PRECISION 1024 (to change the # of digits in MPFR)
