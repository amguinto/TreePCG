	We have test cases stored in the 'graphs' folder.

	Each test case will be stored in a folder designated by the first two 
letters of the person's name + the index of the current graph. For example,
if Serban has 3 test cases, they will be in graphs/se/1, graphs/se/2, 
graphs/se/3. This is probably not the best we can do, but it at least seems
like a decent starting point. 

	Each test case folder will hold 4 files - adjacency matrix of the graph, 
adjacency matrix of the tree, left hand side, and right hand side. The left
hand side file might be empty. So, for example, graphs/se/3 might store:
adj.txt, tree.txt, lhs.txt, rhs.txt.
	Later, we might want to add other stuff, such as generators and what not.
However, the above seems like a reasonable starting point. 
	
	We can store the results of our experiments in a google spreadsheet, for 
each graph storing the following information (inspired by Haoran's workflow):
	- name of test graph
	- # vertices
	- # edges
	- average stretch
	- precision we are going for in the solve
	- #iterations for 64 bit precision
	- 64 bit runtime
	- #iterations for 1024 bit precision
	- 1024 bit runtime
	- condition number - nice to have if we can compute it in a decent time
	- compiler + system architecture
